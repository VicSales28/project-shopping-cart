# Shopping Cart 🛒

My first Front-end module project was successfully completed 🚀

I developed it while I was studying asynchhronous JS at Trybe Programming School

The main objective of this project was to develop a dynamic shopping cart 🛒

For that, it was necessary to **request data directly from an API** of Mercado Livre Brasil

In addition, I performed ✨**test-driven development**✨ to build good quality code

### Files and Functions

The `tests` folder contains the `fetchProduct.test.js` and `fetchProductsList.test.js` files where I implemented the tests for each of the functions of the same name.

The `helpers` folder contains the `fetchFunctions.js` file, where I implemented the request for the APIs of Mercado Livre Brasil.

In `main.js`, I implemented the logic for the notification messages and render the products on the screen.

In the `shopFunctions.js` file, I implemented the logic of adding items to the cart, saving their information in Local Storage and also removing products from the shopping cart.

The `helpers` folder contains the `cartFunctions.js` file where I implemented the logic of saving product prices in Local Storage.

In `cepFunctions.js`, I implemented the logic to query the users' postal address.

### ESLint e Stylelint

To ensure code quality, the `ESLint` and `Stylelint` linters were used in this project.
So the code will be available with good development practices, being more readable and easy to maintain!

ESLint is a tool for identifying and reporting patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code. In many ways it is similar to JSLint and JSHint with a few exceptions:

* ESLint uses Espree for JavaScript parsing.
* ESLint uses an AST to evaluate patterns in code.
* ESLint is completely 'pluggable', each of the rules is a plugin and you can add […]
